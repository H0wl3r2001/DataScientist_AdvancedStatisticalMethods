# Data Scientist - Advanced Statistical Methods

Now that the concepts behind acquiring data and the due process of Cleaning, Preprocessing, Extensive Analysis resulting in the processed data is complete (see [EDA](https://github.com/H0wl3r2001/EDA_FeatureEngineering)), we come across the need to initialize a model and train it with said data.

This repository contains information regarding the most common advanced statistical models used. We will dive deep in:

- **Simple Linear Regression**
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **Logistical Regression**
- **Cluster Analysis (K-Means Cluestering)**

Each theme will have its own Jupyter notebook dedicated to it, with explanation of said model and practical examples of application.
