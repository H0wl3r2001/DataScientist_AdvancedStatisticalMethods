    "\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a fundamental statistical method in Data Science used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and multiple independent variables (features). Unlike Simple Linear Regression, MLR allows us to account for multiple predictors simultaneously, making it more powerful for real-world datasets where multiple factors influence the outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since in the [Linear Regression](LinearRegression.ipynb) notebook we covered the more basic concepts, here we will delve into sconcepts such as the changed key metrics (such as Adjusted R-quared), testing the significance of the model, OLS Assumptions and Dummy Variables.\n",
